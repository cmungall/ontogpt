Abstract
One challenge in miRNA–genes–diseases interaction studies is that it is challenging to
find labeled data that indicate a positive or negative relationship between miRNA and
genes. The use of one-class classification methods shows a promising path for validating
them. We have applied two one-class classification methods, Isolation Forest and
One-class SVM, to validate miRNAs interactions with the ERBB2 gene present in breast
cancer scenarios using features extracted via sequence-binding. We found that the
One-class SVM outperforms the Isolation Forest model, with values of sensitivity of
80.49% and a specificity of 86.49% showing results that are comparable to previous studies.
Additionally, we have demonstrated that the use of features extracted from a
sequence-based approach (considering miRNA and gene sequence binding characteristics)
and one-class models have proven to be a feasible method for validating these genetic
molecule interactions.
