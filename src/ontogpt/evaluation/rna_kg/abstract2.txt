MicroRNA (miRNA)–gene interactions are well-recognized as involved in the progression
of almost all cancer types including prostate cancer, which is one of the most common
cancers in men. This study explored the significantly dysregulated genes and miRNAs and
elucidated the potential miRNA–gene regulatory network in prostate cancer. Integrative
analysis of prostate cancer and normal prostate transcriptomic data in The Cancer Genome
Atlas dataset was conducted using both differential expression analysis and weighted
correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Thirteen genes (RRM2, ORC6, CDC45, CDKN2A, E2F2,
MYBL2, CCNB2, PLK1, FOXM1, CDC25C, PKMYT1, GTSE1, and CDC20) were potentially
correlated with prostate cancer based on functional enrichment analyses. MiRNAs
targeting these genes were predicted and eight miRNAs were intersections between
those miRNAs and the hub miRNAs obtained from miRNA WGCNA analysis. Three genes
(E2F2, RRM2, and PKMYT1) and four miRNAs (hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-20a-5p, hsa-mir-92a-3p,
and hsa-mir-93-5p) were key factors according to the interaction network. RRM2 and
PKMYT1 were significantly related to survival. These findings partially elucidated
the dysregulation of gene expressions in prostate cancer. Efficient manipulations of
the miRNA–gene interactions in prostate cancer may be exploited as promising therapeutics.
