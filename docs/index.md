# Introduction

_OntoGPT_ is a Python package for extracting structured information from text with large language models (LLMs), _instruction prompts_, and ontology-based grounding. It works well with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models as well as a selection of other LLMs. OntoGPT's output can be used for general-purpose natural language tasks (e.g., named entity recognition and relation extraction), summarization, knowledge base and knowledge graph construction, and more.

## Methods

Two different strategies for knowledge extraction are currently implemented in OntoGPT:

* SPIRES: *Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics*
  * A Zero-shot learning (ZSL) approach to extracting nested semantic structures from text
  * This approach takes two inputs - 1) LinkML schema 2) free text, and outputs knowledge in a structure conformant with the supplied schema in JSON, YAML, RDF or OWL formats
  * Uses GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, or one of a variety of open LLMs on your local machine
* SPINDOCTOR: *Structured Prompt Interpolation of Narrative Descriptions Or Controlled Terms for Ontological Reporting*
  * Summarizes gene set descriptions (pseudo gene-set enrichment)
  * Uses GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4

## Quick Start

Please see the Setup page on the left for more detailed instructions.

OntoGPT runs on the command line, though there's also a minimal web app interface (see `Web Application` section below).

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or greater installed.
2. Install with `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install ontogpt
    ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    runoak set-apikey -e openai <your openai api key>
    ```

4. See the list of all OntoGPT commands:

    ```bash
    ontogpt --help
    ```

5. Try a simple example of information extraction:

    ```bash
    echo "One treatment for high blood pressure is carvedilol." > example.txt
    ontogpt extract -i example.txt -t drug
    ```

    OntoGPT will retrieve the necessary ontologies and output results to the command line. Your output will provide all extracted objects under the heading `extracted_object`.

## Web Applications

There is a bare bones web application for running OntoGPT and viewing results.

First, install the required dependencies with `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install ontogpt[web]
```

Then run this command to start the web application:

```bash
web-ontogpt
```

NOTE: We do not recommend hosting this webapp publicly without authentication.

Gene enrichment has its own webapp powered by Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run src/ontogpt/streamlit/spindoctor.py
```
